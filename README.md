# Oasis Infobyte Java Internship Task 3: ATM Interface

Welcome to the ATM Interface project, a Java-based console application that simulates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project, developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Java Internship, demonstrates the practical application of Java in creating user-friendly, real-world applications.

## Overview

The ATM Interface is designed to mimic the operations of a real ATM. It's built using Java and encompasses five distinct classes, each contributing to the seamless execution of various banking transactions. This console-based application begins by prompting the user for their ID and PIN. Upon successful authentication, users can access a range of ATM services.

## Features

The application offers the following functionalities:

1. **Transactions History**: View a log of all past transactions.
2. **Withdraw**: Withdraw money from your account.
3. **Deposit**: Deposit funds into your account.
4. **Transfer**: Transfer funds to another account.
5. **Quit**: Exit the application.
